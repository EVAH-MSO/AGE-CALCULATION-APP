# Age Calculator App

A simple web-based age calculator that lets users enter their birth date and calculates their age in years, months, and days.

## Overview

This project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features a clean and responsive user interface. Users input the day, month, and year of their birth, and the app calculates their current age based on the provided information.

## Features

- *User Input:*  
  Allows users to input their day, month, and year of birth.
- *Responsive Design:*  
  The design is responsive, ensuring a smooth experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
- *Instant Results:*  
  The age is calculated and displayed immediately after submission.

## How It Works

1. *HTML Structure:*  
   The main HTML file (index.html) contains a form with input fields for the day, month, and year. It also includes a section to display the calculated age.

2. *CSS Styling:*  
   The styling is defined in age.css, which provides the visual layout and responsive behavior.

3. *JavaScript Functionality:*  
   The logic to calculate the age is handled by age.js. When the form is submitted, the script reads the input values, calculates the age, and updates the HTML to show the results.

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/age-calculator-app.git
